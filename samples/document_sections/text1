As an example, the following RTF code:

{\rtf1\ansi{\fonttbl\f0\fswiss Helvetica;}\f0
Hello!\par\par
This is some {\b bold} text.\par
}
would be rendered like this when read by an appropriate word processor:

Hello!

This is some bold text.

A backslash (\) starts an RTF control code. The \par control code indicates a new line, and \b switches to a bold typeface. Braces ({ and }) define a group; the example uses a group to limit the scope of the \b control code. Everything else will be treated as clear text, or the text to be formatted. A valid RTF document is a group starting with the \rtf control code.
